			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Some pretty damn good scallops.</p>
	
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>6 half-shelled scallops</li>
				<li>30 grams unsalted butter</li>
				<li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
				<li>a small pinch of salt</li>
				<li>freshly cracked black pepper</li>
				<li>60 grams shredded mozerella cheese</li>
				<li>dried parsely flakes</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Remove scallop meat from the shell, rinse the meat thoroughly and remove any dirty bits. Scald the scallop shells in hot water for a few minutes to disinfect, discard hot water and rinse the shells. Return scallop meat to the shell.</li>
				<li>Place cubed butter in a small bowl and microwave for 40 seconds. Use a spoon to stir the butter vigorously to form a smooth paste. Add mayonnaise, salt and pepper; stir to combine well.</li>
				<li>Place scallops on foil or parchment-lined oven tray. Bake scallops in pre-heated oven of 200°C (392°F) for 5 minutes.</li>
				<li>Using kitchen tongs, carefully drain the scallop broth collected in the shells in a small bowl. You can use the broth for flavouring other dishes.</li>
				<li>Divide and spoon the mayonnaise mixture evenly among the scallops. Top with shredded cheese.</li>
				<li>Return scallops to the oven and bake for another 8 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and slightly browned at the edges. Top with dried parsley flakes before serving.</li>
			</ol>
